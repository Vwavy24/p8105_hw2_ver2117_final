After tidying and merging the Mr Trash and Professor trash dataset, the
number of observations(641) is 641.Some key variables include weight(in
tons), the volume(cubic yards), cigarette butts, glass bottles, grocery
bags, dumpster label, the date(myd), plastic bottles, polystyrene, chip
bags, sports, and the homes powered.The total number of sports balls in
2020 collected by Mr. Trash Wheel(856) is 856. The number of columns or
categories in the dataset(15) is 15. The other dataset that was tidyed
was the Professor Trash Wheel which is the second excel sheet. The total
weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel (190.12) is
`rsum(pull(prof_trash,weight_tons))`. The number of observations in the
Professor Trash Wheel(94) dataset is `rnrow(prof_trash)`. The number of
columns(14) for this dataset is 14. Some key variables were weight( in
tons), plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarette butts, glass bottles,
grocery bags, chip bags.
